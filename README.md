The data used comes from the `Oxford University` website [ourworldindata.org](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) as `main dataframe` and from [John Hopkins University](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv) for `recovered cases`.

We plan to eventually include data sets from other sources in order to add features.
